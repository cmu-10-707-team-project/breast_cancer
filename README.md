## Folder Structure

## Baseline Algorithm
- Extract WSIs images at Ã—32 Magnification level
- Data pre-processing: remove background and potential annotations
- Resize images to (1024, 450) for improving training efficiency
- Three-layer CNN:

## Patch Framework
- Each original input WSIs was stored as a series of tiles
- Convert each tile into a patch
- Use converted image patches, size of (256, 256) for training
